# CS50x-Intro-to-Computer-Science

I made this repository to post my solutions to Harvard University's 2020 CS50 intro course assignments and document my progress during the course.
You can find the materials for the course [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/) or look at the assignments specifications linked at right of every section in the table of contents.

Hope this is helpful to other students, if you don't mind please leave a star! Every exercise in this repository scored 100% on submission.
